TA for Switcheo Labs Frontend Engineer Intern Position

Problems 1, 2, and 3 have been completed with no setup requirements

Due to the nature of this project setup,
- Tailwind CSS Play CDN has been added to the <head> tag within the html file to skip over any build step
- JSON data has been manually embedded into the <script> tag within the html file for rendering

While this is not the standard practice for web apps, it allows direct viewing of the page without the
need to setup a local development environment.

Thank you for reading!
