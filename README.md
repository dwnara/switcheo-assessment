TA for Switcheo Labs Frontend Engineer Intern position
Problems 1, 2, and 3 have been completed without any specific setup requirements

Due to the nature of the project, the following adjustments have been made
- Integrated Tailwind CSS Play CDN into the head tag within the HTML file, bypassing any build steps.
- Manually embedded JSON data within the script tag in the HTML file, facilitating easy rendering

While I acknowledge that these methods deviate from the standard practices in web application development,
they enable direct viewing of the page without necessarily setting up a local development environment.

Thank you for reading!
