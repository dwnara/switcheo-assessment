TA for Switcheo Labs Frontend Engineer Intern Position

Questions have been completed with no setup requirements

Due to the nature of the project setup,
- Tailwind CSS Play CDN was added to the <head> tag within the index.html file to skip over any build step
- JSON data was embedded manually into the <script> tag within the index.html file for rendering without accessing terminal

While this is not standard practice for web applications, it allows for direct viewing of the page without the need to set up a local development environment.
